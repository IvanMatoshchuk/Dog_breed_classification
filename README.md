## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All necessary libraries can be observed in the code.
Pre-trained bottleneck features for ResNet50 can be downloaded from here [ResNet-50](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz).
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in enhancing my knowledge in deep learning area, mainly by learning the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Networks. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ivan.matoshchuk/how-do-you-save-money-on-airbnb-booking-aa660e690a90).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBNB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
