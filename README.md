## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All necessary libraries can be observed in the code.
Pre-trained bottleneck features for ResNet50 can be downloaded from here [ResNet-50](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz).
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in enhancing my knowledge in deep learning area, mainly by learning the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Networks. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  
Udacity provides the following data of dog images:
``` 
There are 133 total dog categories.
There are 8351 total dog images.

There are 6680 training dog images.
There are 835 validation dog images.
There are 836 test dog images.
```
And for the data of human photos:

`There are 13233 total human images.`


## Results<a name="results"></a>
